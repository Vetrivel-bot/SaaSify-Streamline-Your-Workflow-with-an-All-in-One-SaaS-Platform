https://github.com/Vetrivel-bot/SaaSify-Streamline-Your-Workflow-with-an-All-in-One-SaaS-Platform

Please generate a complete README.md (in Markdown) that includes:

1. **Project Title & Badge Strip**  
   - The repo name (“SaaSify – Streamline Your Workflow…”).  
   - Shields badges for build status, npm version (or GitHub Releases), license, and downloads.

2. **Short Description**  
   - One‑ or two‑sentence elevator pitch.

3. **Table of Contents**  
   - Links to each major section.

4. **Features**  
   - A bullet list of the key platform features (Smart Automation, Advanced Analytics, Team Collaboration, etc.), each with a 1‑line description.

5. **Demo & Screenshots**  
   - Embed or link to a hosted demo, plus 2–3 screenshots of the dashboard, feature UI, mobile view, etc., with alt‑text.

6. **Getting Started**  
   - Prerequisites (Node.js, pnpm or npm, etc.)  
   - Installation steps:
     1. `git clone …`
     2. `cd SaaSify-…`
     3. `pnpm install` (or `npm install`)
     4. `pnpm dev` (or `npm run dev`)
   - How to build for production.

7. **Configuration**  
   - Environment variables / config file details (e.g. API keys, database URL).

8. **Usage**  
   - How to run tests (`pnpm test`), linters, formatters.  
   - How to deploy (Vercel, Netlify, Docker, etc.).

9. **API Reference**  
   - If there’s a backend or REST/WebSocket API, document endpoints, request/response examples.

10. **Contributing**
